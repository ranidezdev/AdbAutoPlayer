"""This module provides a utility function `execute` to safely invoke callable objects.

The `execute` function handles both bound and unbound methods, automatically
instantiating classes if necessary. It captures and logs exceptions, with special
handling for `GenericAdbError` related to Android Debug Bridge permissions.

Usage:
    - Call `execute` with a function and optionally an instance and kwargs.
    - Returns any exception encountered during execution, or None if successful.

This utility simplifies error handling and invocation of callables that may require
an instance context or special error processing.
